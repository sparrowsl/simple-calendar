				<p>Most people are interested in technology but they lack the resources to learn, the road map in a specific area of study, the community of other learners or the idea of what job is available, and most times find it hard to connect with others that are also interested/learning about the vast technology skills <em>(especially students and self taughts)</em>.</p>
					 
				<p>Finding people that live in the same town scares most learners off and kills their drive and passion for tech. They will have no option but to choose another field of study instead of following their dream. Our aim is to bring all these people together, provide resources, road maps, guidance and the help they need to grow into a good <b>IT</b> engineer.</p>
