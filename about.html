					<b title="Sierra Leone Association for Developers">SLAD</b> is a non profit organization with the 
					aim of helping Sierra Leoneans <i>(young &amp; old)</i> that are passionate about tech.
				</p>

					<p>
						We aim to help by pairing people with the same skill level 
						<i>(reducing the Impostor Syndrome)</i> and try to bring experienced 
						mentors/people from different fields to help <b><em>Lead and train developers, 
						Organizing Hackatons, Bootcamps and various Competitions</em></b>.

				<p>
					Most people are interested in technology but they lack the resources to learn, 
					the road map in a specific area of study, the community of other learners or the 
					idea of what job is available, and most times find it hard to connect with others 
					that are also interested/learning about the vast technology skills 
					<em>(especially students and self taughts).</em>
				</p>
					 
				<p>
					Finding people that live in the same town scares most learners off and kills their 
					drive and passion for tech. They will have no option but to choose another field of 
					study instead of following their dreams. Our aim is to bring all these people together, 
					provide resources, road maps, guidance and the help they need to grow into a good developers.
